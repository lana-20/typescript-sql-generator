### In progress ...

I started working on a project using ChatGPT-4 (GPT-4 model) to create a *SQL Generator*.

The app will be able to save your messages in the chat and then display the final outcome (the SQL query you ask it to write) in a code section.

You'll be able to scroll through all the previous chats, as well as clear the chat.

I'm building this in TypeScript for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and OpenAI API using the chat completions endpoint.

I'm using IntelliJ's WebStorm IDE. If you are not using WebStorm, all you need to do is get your terminal up, find the directory you want to work in, use command <code>npx create-react-app my-app --template-typescript</code>, and hit <code>Enter</code>.
